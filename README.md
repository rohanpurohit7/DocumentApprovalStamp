For this application I used the pythagorean theorem and the SOHCAHTOA formula to get the angle of the diagonal stamp. It will always stamp in the relative middle at a 45 degree angle regardless of the shape and size and orientation of the input document, which is better than an absolute positoning of the diagonal stamp.
