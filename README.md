For this application I used the pythagorean theorem and the SOHCAHTOA formula to get the angle of the diagonal stamp. It will always stamp in the middle at a 45 degree angle regardless of the shape and size and orientation of the input document. It does so by getting the tan of Opposite/ Adjacent sides of a paper which are always 45 degrees.
