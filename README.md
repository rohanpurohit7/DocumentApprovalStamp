For this application I used the pythagorean theorem and the SOHCAHTOA formula to get the angle of the diagonal stamp. It will always stamp in the relative middle at a 45 degree angle regardless of the shape and size and orientation of the input document, which is better than an absolute positoning of the diagonal stamp.  

*My watermarker app works best with pages sized 8.50x 11.00 inches.Or standard A4 paper sized document files. The positioning of the stamp is based on those dimensions. If you want to stamp different sizes of papers you have to tweak the stamp positioning code.
